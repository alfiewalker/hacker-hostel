# Mentorship: Hacker Hostel Trinidad & Tobago

In July of 2018, I volunteered for a mentorship program in Trinidada and Tobago. I was one of the meontors. This was one of the started projects I created to get the talented budding programmers fired up to code.

The PowerPoint give the overview of the technology stack I was introducing to the young engineers.
